# Deep-Learning-Fundamentals-with-Keras--EDX
I have done this course on EDX and it was extremely useful for me.

# The course has covered the following-
## Deep Learning with the neural network(Regression and Classification)
## Supervised Learning

Convolutional neural network

Recurrence neural network

Long short-term memory network

## UnSupervised Learning

Autoencoders(Restricted Boltzmann Machine)
