This gave an explicit example of learned behavior. Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it would have been easier to write the function Y=2x-1 directly, instead of bothering with using Machine Learning to learn the relationship between X and Y for a fixed set of values, and extending that for all values.\n","\n","But what about a scenario where writing rules like that is much more difficult -- for example a computer vision problem?
